# Machine_Learning_Projects
This repository contains my machine learning projects, ranging from beginner-level implementations to more advanced real-world applications. The projects cover data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and practical problem-solving using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and NLTK.
